TODO

More web endpoints
  - Vector tiles
  - Activity as GeoJSON
  - Known property keys? For a UI dropdown
  - Export PNG of selected region

Customization
  - Support AND/OR/NOT for property filters
  - Vary gradient stops based on zoom level / max number of points in tile
  - Filter parser (instead of JSON-based AST)

CLI
  - `init` command (or similar) to create / configure empty DB
    (maybe this is where we set zoom levels etc.)

Misc
  - "privacy zones" rather than start/end trim distance
  - Strip noisy points from tracks (e.g. inside buildings, etc.)
  - Remap column names from Strava API to match `activities.csv` (or vice versa?)
